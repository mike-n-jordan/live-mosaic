## What is this all about?

Help us complete our image mosaics by adding your entry to our collaborative message board!
Every entry automatically adds a tile to the current image mosaic in progress.


## What can I win?

- Participating earns you a ticket in our raffle to win one of five **Â£250 Amazon vouchers**.
- Additionally, we have some optional [challenges](./CHALLENGES.md)  that can earn you one of six **Â£50 Amazon vouchers**. These are on a first come, first served basis, and a maximum of one per person.

Weâ€™ll announce the winning raffle tickets at our booth and on @bumble_inc at 4pm on Friday, 27th October!


## How can I participate?

Get familiar with `Entry` class and its types:

- `Text`: A simple message
- `Image`: A photo
- `CustomComposable`: get creative!

- Create and add your `Entry` instance to the list in `Entries.kt`!
- Create a pull request and the Bumble Inc team will review it!
- Show us your pull request at the Bumble Inc. booth on your device, and once we merge it, weâ€™ll hand you your raffle ticket.

## I donâ€™t have a laptop with me, how can I participate?

Creating a text entry is simple enough that you could easily do it from mobile! See [GitHub Mobile](https://github.com/mobile)
